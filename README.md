## Introduction

Zetsy is a Zelda Breath of the Wild themed clone of Etsy, an e-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items and supplies, as well as unique factory-manufactured items. Zetsy is built on a Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.

## Features
### Feature 1 - Demo and User Accounts
A visitor to Zetsy can browse all available products without logging in. In addition, they have the ability to navigate the site as a Demo User by clicking on the Demo button on the top-right of the page. Lastly, a visitor has the ability to register for a new account and sign in with valid credentials.

### Feature 2 - Product listings
The listings page displays all of the items available for sale on Zetsy. Each item has a brief overview of product information including: an image of the product, the product name, and the price of the camera.

Clicking on the image of a product from the listings page brings the visitor to the individual product show page, where additional product information is displayed. From here a use can select the quantity they would like to purchase and click on the Add to Cart button to place the item in their shopping cart.

### Feature 3 - Shopping cart
The shopping cart lists all of the items a logged in user has added. From their cart, a user has the ability to remove items, update item quantity, view subtotal and total costs, and checkout.

## Future Improvements
There are several features and improvements that I would like to make to Zetsy in the future. Some of these include:

* Search - Allow users to search for items available for sale of Zetsy
* Comments/Reviews - Allow users to leave comments and reviews on items
* Category Filters - Allow users to view specific products based on their category
